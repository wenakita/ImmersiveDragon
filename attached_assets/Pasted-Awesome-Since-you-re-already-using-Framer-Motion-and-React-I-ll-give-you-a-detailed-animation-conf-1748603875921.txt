Awesome! Since you‚Äôre already using Framer Motion and React, I‚Äôll give you a detailed animation config and implementation tips that fit perfectly with your current setup.
This will make it super easy for you (or GPT-4) to orchestrate every effect, including audio fade-in, advanced scene transitions, glitch effects, and token swaps, all precisely synced to the phonk beat.

üü† Framer Motion/React: Cinematic Splash Animation Config
1. Animation Steps/Config Array Example
js
Copy
Edit
export const splashSteps = [
  {
    key: "audio-fade-in",
    start: 0,
    duration: 2000, // ms
    action: "audioFadeIn", // Custom hook/logic
    details: { from: 0, to: 0.7 }
  },
  {
    key: "title",
    start: 2000,
    duration: 4000,
    action: "typewriter",
    text: "Sonic Red Dragon",
    variants: { neonGlow: true }

  },
  {
    key: "fee",
    start: 11800,
    duration: 2000,
    action: "slideIn",
    text: "10% fee on all swaps",

    effect: "countUpPercent"
  },
  {
    key: "lottery",

    action: "flip3D",
    text: "Every swap = lottery ticket",
    effect: "coinBurst"
  },
  {
    key: "unique",
    start: 16800,
    duration: 2500,
    action: "shimmerFadeIn",
    text: "Results are instantaneous and unique",
    effect: "slotSpin"
  },
  {
    key: "table",
    start: 19300,
    duration: 8000,
    action: "alternatingSlideIn",
    rows: [
      { row: "$10 = 0.004%", from: "left" },
      { row: "$100 = 0.04%", from: "right" },
      { row: "$1,000 = 0.4%", from: "left" },
      { row: "$10,000 = 4%", from: "right" }
    ],
    effect: "glowOnArrival"
  },
  {
    key: "vrf",
    start: 27300,
    duration: 4000,
    action: "slideUpScale",
    text: "Provable Fairness Powered by Chainlink VRF",
    effect: "fireGlow"
  }
];
2. How to Drive the Sequence
Step 1: Audio Fade-In (in React)
js
Copy
Edit
// Use inside a useEffect or useInterval that polls audioRef.current.currentTime
if (audioRef.current && step.action === "audioFadeIn") {
  const progress = Math.min(1, (audioCurrentTime / 2.0));
  audioRef.current.volume = 0.7 * progress; // From 0 to 0.7 over 2s
}
Step 2: Animation Rendering Logic
Instead of just stepping every N ms, use a render loop tied to audio‚Äôs currentTime:

js
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  let raf;
  function animateStep() {
    const time = audioRef.current?.currentTime * 1000 || 0;
    const step = splashSteps.find(
      s => time >= s.start && time < s.start + s.duration
    );
    if (step && step.key !== currentStep.key) {
      setCurrentStep(step); // Trigger new scene
    }
    raf = requestAnimationFrame(animateStep);
  }
  if (audioStarted) {
    raf = requestAnimationFrame(animateStep);
  }
  return () => raf && cancelAnimationFrame(raf);
}, [audioStarted, currentStep]);
Step 3: Creative Framer Motion Variants
Define custom motion variants for your special effects (glitch, bounce, flip, etc.), and assign per step:

js
Copy
Edit
const glitchVariant = {
  visible: {
    filter: [
      "none",
      "blur(1px) contrast(1.5)",
      "none",
      "hue-rotate(10deg)",
      "none"
    ],
    x: [0, -4, 2, 0, 0],
    transition: { duration: 0.12 }
  }
};
// ... more variants for bounce, coin burst, etc.
And in your render:

js
Copy
Edit
<motion.h2
  variants={currentStep.variants}
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  exit="hidden"
>
  {currentStep.text}
</motion.h2>
Step 4: Swap Animation Example
js
Copy
Edit
{currentStep.action === "swapPhase" && (
  <div className="relative flex justify-center items-center w-full">
    <motion.img
      src={tokenImg(currentStep.token)}
      initial={{ x: currentStep.direction === "left" ? -200 : 200, opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1, scale: 1.2 }}
      exit={{ x: currentStep.direction === "left" ? -400 : 400, opacity: 0 }}
      transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
      className="w-20 h-20"
    />
    <motion.h2 className="text-3xl">{currentStep.text}</motion.h2>
  </div>
)}
3. Bonus: Advanced Effects
For glitch: Layer 2‚Äì3 colored copies slightly offset, animate their positions and opacity.

For coin burst: Map an array of coin icons, animate with staggered motion.divs radiating out.

For countUpPercent: Animate a state variable from 0 to 10 over 0.7s using a custom hook or react-spring.

üöÄ How To Use This Config with GPT/LLM
Just describe your step config and say:

‚ÄúFor each step, use Framer Motion‚Äôs variants and timing to match the ‚Äòstart‚Äô and ‚Äòduration‚Äô properties. Orchestrate scene transitions by polling the audio‚Äôs currentTime. For swap steps, animate the tokens sliding and crossing; for glitch, apply filters/offsets on text. Always start with an audio fade-in over 2s.‚Äù

This is a universal, extensible animation script for GPTs, devs, or designers.
