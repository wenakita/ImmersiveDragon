Sonic Red Dragon Promo – Animation Script (Timecoded to Audio)
Assumptions:

The track is ~2:12 long (“kwa-tempo-phonk-212904.mp3”).

You’ll adjust exact timestamps after a rough timing pass—this script gives you a tight starting point.

Each “beat drop,” phrase change, or prominent musical cue is a good place for a new animation.

[00:00–00:07] Intro / Atmosphere
Music: Ambient intro (light, tension-building)

Animation:

Typewriter effect:
Text: "Sonic Red Dragon" (center screen)
Classic, slow typewriter effect, one letter at a time. Subtle digital noise/glitch overlay.

Cue: Finish title as the intro beat kicks in.

[00:07–00:12] Call to Action
Music: Beat begins (first kick/snare)

Animation:

Slide up:
Text: "Swap $S for $DRAGON"
Slides up from bottom, slight bounce at end. Faint fire/glow effect.

Cue: Start just before or on the first main downbeat.

[00:12–00:17] Reveal the Twist
Music: Synth/beat intensifies, tension builds

Animation:

Scale animation:
Text: "But there's a twist"
Text pops in from center, scales up 120% then settles to normal size.

Cue: Triggered by a snare or a dramatic note.

[00:17–00:22] Mechanic Reveal
Music: Groove stabilizes (regular beat)

Animation:

Slide from left:
Text: "10% fee on all swaps"
Slides in from the left, with a bold whoosh sound effect.

Cue: Sync with strong drum hit.

[00:22–00:28] Game-Changer
Music: Subtle build, maybe a melodic change or vocal sample

Animation:

3D flip:
Text: "Every swap = lottery ticket"
Text flips in 3D around the Y-axis. Add a sparkle or light sweep after it lands.

Cue: On a musical flourish, fill, or prominent effect.

[00:28–00:34] Reassurance / Results
Music: Sustained groove, melodic phrase

Animation:

Static/dissolve:
Text: "Results are instantaneous and unique to each swap"
Text fades/dissolves in gently, possible shimmer over the words.

Cue: On a calm moment or softer part of the beat.

[00:34–00:54] Probability Table
Music: Music may have alternating phrases or repeated melodic elements.

Animation:

Alternating slide animations (left/right):
For each probability or reward tier (e.g.,
"1 in 100 = Jackpot",
"1 in 20 = Bonus",
etc.):
First slides in from the left, next from the right, alternate for all items. Each syncs with a new measure or main beat.

Cue: Each entry appears on a distinct musical hit or every 2–3 seconds.

[00:54–End (approx. 01:10–01:30)] Finale: VRF/Trust
Music: Track builds to a peak or final phrase.

Animation:

Slide up + scale:
Text: "Provable Fairness Powered by Chainlink VRF"
Slides up, then gently scales up (105–110%) as the final message. Possible animated Chainlink VRF logo and fire/dragon effect in the background. End with logo lockup and social/CTA.

Cue: Start on the biggest drop or final chorus, let it breathe for 6–10 seconds.

[End Screen / Outro]
Music: Track fades, last synth echoes.

Animation:

Show "SonicRedDragon.io" (or your call-to-action/hashtag), subtle glow or embers, then fade to black.

Script Notes for Any AI/Editor
Sync each animation change to a clear musical cue (downbeat, drop, or phrase shift).

Duration of each segment can be adjusted depending on pacing and track structure.

Transition effects (fire, shimmer, glitch) should accent but not overpower text.

Each section’s main message must be clearly readable before transitioning.

Keep timing tight (1–2 seconds per word in typewriter, 3–6 seconds per major point).
